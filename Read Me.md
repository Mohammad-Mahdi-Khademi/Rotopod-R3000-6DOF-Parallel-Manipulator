# Rotopod R-3000 – 6-DOF Parallel Manipulator

## Project Overview
This project presents the **design, simulation, and analysis** of a **Rotopod R-3000** (Stewart Platform).  
The work combines **SolidWorks modeling**, **CoppeliaSim simulation**, and **MATLAB kinematic analysis** to study its motion and optimize the design.
